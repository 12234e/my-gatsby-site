14 ‘Health Foods’ That May Not Be as Nutritious as You Thought
We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission Here’s our process.


How we vet brands and products

Navigating the grocery aisles in search of nutritious foods has become increasingly complex as an increasingly large number of so-called healthy products fill the shelves.

Companies often use wording on product labels and in their marketing to appeal to customers who are trying to make healthier choices. You might see claims on labels like:

low fat
vegan
gluten-free
low carb
Unfortunately, just because a food uses words like these on its label or is generally thought of as healthier than other foods doesn’t mean it’s good for you.

Here are 14 foods that may not be as healthy as their marketing claims make them out to be.

1. Granola and granola bars
People have championed granola and granola bars as “healthy” foods for decades.

Even though some granolas and granola bars are quite nutritious, many are packed with added sugar and very high in calories.

For example, a 2/3-cup (67-gram) serving of Nature Valley Oats and Dark Chocolate Protein Granola contains 7 grams of added sugar and 290 calories, while Quaker Chewy Yogurt Granola Bars pack 10 grams of added sugar per bar (1, 2).

The recommended Daily Value (DV) for sugar is 50 grams for a person who consumes 2,000 calories per day, according to the Food and Drug Administration (3Trusted Source).

For optimal health, it’s best to limit your added sugar intake as much as possible, as consuming too much added sugar can contribute to an increased risk of many health conditions in both adults and kids.

These health conditions include (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source):

obesity
fatty liver
heart disease
Instead of buying premade granola at the store, try making your own granola and granola bars at home. You can use nutritious ingredients like nuts and oats and add sweetness with dried fruit.

2. Flavored yogurts
Yogurt can be a healthy choice, but it’s best to opt for unsweetened yogurt whenever possible.

Flavored and “fruit on the bottom” yogurts can contain a surprising amount of sugar in just a small serving.

For example, a 5.3-ounce (150-gram) container of Dannon Strawberry Fruit on the Bottom yogurt contains a hefty 15 grams of added sugar. Yogurts that have candy to
